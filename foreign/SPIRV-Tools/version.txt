    Combine extinst-name and extinst-output-base into one arg. (#3200)
    
    * Combine the extinst-name and extinst-output-base into one arg.
    
    Some build systems such as Android blueprints require that the inputs
    and outputs of generator scripts are all provided as arguments.  These
    two arguments to generate_language_headers.py are combined to form the
    output path in the script.  This change simply lets the user provide the
    whole output path as an argument.
    
    * Fix typo in build_defs.bzl and update Android.mk
