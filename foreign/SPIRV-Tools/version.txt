    spirv-fuzz: Always add new globals to entry point interfaces (#3113)
    
    In the context of SPIR-V 1.4 or higher, global variables cannot be
    used by an instruction unless they are listed in the interface of all
    entry points that might invoke the instruction.  This change
    conservatively adds new global variables to the interfaces of all
    entry points (if the SPIR-V version is 1.4 or higher).
    
    Issue #3111 notes that a more rigorous approach to entry point
    interfaces could be taken in spirv-fuzz, which would allow being less
    conservative here.
